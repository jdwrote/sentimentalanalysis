**Sentiment Analysis of Stock Market Articles**
=====================================================

This repository contains a Python script that analyzes the sentiment of stock market articles using 
natural language processing (NLP) techniques. The code utilizes Lang Chain to generate embeddings, which are then 
processed by APIs from OpenAI and/or LLaMA3 to determine the sentiment of the article's text.

**Key Features:**

* Sentiment analysis of stock market articles
* Utilizes OpenAI API or LLaMA3 model for generating sentiment
* Leverages Lang Chain (RAG tools)
* Classifies sentiment into four categories: bullish, bearish, neutral, or not available
* Displays results in a mobile app for easy consumption

**How it Works:**

1. The script retrieves article text from online sources using OpenAI API or LLaMA3 model.
2. Lang Chain (RAG tools) is used to generate embeddings based on the article's text.
3. NLP techniques are applied to analyze the sentiment of each article, identifying mentions of specific 
stocks and their corresponding sentiment (bullish, bearish, neutral, or not available).
4. The sentiment analysis is then displayed in a mobile app, allowing users to quickly identify articles 
related to stocks they're interested in.

**Technical Requirements:**

* Python 3.x
* OpenAI API key
* LLaMA3 model (or equivalent)
* Lang Chain (RAG tools) library
* Mobile app development framework (e.g., React Native or Flutter)

**Mobile App Features:**

* Article summary with sentiment analysis
* Stock mentions with corresponding sentiment
* User-friendly interface for easy navigation and reading

**Future Development:**

* Integration with additional APIs for more comprehensive stock data
* Advanced NLP techniques to improve sentiment analysis accuracy
* User authentication and personalized article recommendations
* Support for multiple languages or domains (e.g., news articles, social media posts)
* Enhanced mobile app features, such as push notifications or alerts based on sentiment analysis

**Why it matters:**

By leveraging AI-powered sentiment analysis, this project enables users to quickly gauge the sentiment of 
stocks mentioned in articles. This information can be used to inform investment decisions, identify 
potential market trends, and stay ahead of the competition.
